        <p class="blog">It doesn’t matter if you’re an absolute beginner or an experienced programmer, going to
            StackOverFlow or GitHub to find solutions to coding problems is a daily occurrence. </p>
        <img id="stack-img" src="/images/stack-logo.png" width="350px" height="auto">
        <p class="blog">Let’s talk about StackOverFlow for a moment. It has people from all over the world where
            developers and coders come together to answer and address problems for just about anyone and for absolutely
            free. Now anyone who has posted a question on the site would argue that the site is a little strict but I
            want you to think about it, when you’re clicking pictures of something, do you keep all of the them or just
            the ones you like, if any duplicates are formed or something that highlights pretty much of the same picture
            would you like to keep and judge every time amongst them which one you liked or wanted to upload on a site.
            No, right? That’s why the community may appear to be strict but they are just ensuring that<mark class="marking"> duplicates are
            not formed and nobody wastes their time answering a question which has already been answered. </mark> </p>
        <br>
        <p class="blog">Another thing I like to highlight about the community is, unlike other fields of studies where
            you have to build something from the very start, say, a novel, a house or just about anything but while
            coding we want to learn the concepts around those building block. We don’t appreciate or encourage building
            everything from scratch. Before you jump on any unsolicited conclusions what I mean by the aforementioned
            statement is that Coding or development doesn’t believe in reinventing the wheel. The reusability of a code
            is a sign of a good block of code, which is why<mark class="marking"> GitHub repositories and NPM libraries
                are so popular. </mark> </p>
        <img class="hero-image" src="/images/community.svg" />
        <p class="blog">Coding and development are one of the most innovative fields all across the world. One has to be
            open to changes and new frameworks to be able to last in this field of work. So,<mark class="marking"> that
                means there’s no end to learning and no absolute expertise. </mark>However, the community is open to
            anyone who has the will and determination to give in the hours to obtain knowledge of any framework. With
            courses easily available on online sites, it is now easier than ever to learn and excel in the field. So, if
            you’re a beginner or someone having experience.<mark class="marking"> Never Stop Learning! </mark> </p>
